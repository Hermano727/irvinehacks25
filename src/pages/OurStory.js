        <p>
          Attending our first hackathon in January of 2025 at Irvine Hacks, four undergraduate students 
          from UCSD and UCI collaborated to create a resource to help those affected by the recent wildfires 
          in California. We have hopes of expanding the website to something greater in the future.
